# 0x1D Binary trees
# A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
# Difference between a binary tree and a BST:
#	 =>A Binary Tree is a non-linear data structure in which a node can have 0, 1 or 2 nodes. Individually, each node consists of a left pointer, right pointer and data element. A Binary Search Tree is an organized binary tree with a structured organization of nodes
# Gain of a Binary Search Tree over Linked List:
#	=>Binary search tree has efficient search (i.e. in order to find
#	     a specific element you don't have to look at all the elements).
#	=>a linkedList is an O(N) traversal data structure, while a BST is a O(N)
#	     traversal data structure in the worst case, and a O(log N) in the best case.
# Depth of bibary tree:
#	=>The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes from the root down to the furthest leaf node. 
#	    In other words, it is the height of a binary tree
# Traversal techniques in a binary tree:
#	=>Preoder
#	=>Inorder 
#	=>Postorder
# A balanced binary tree is the binary tree where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
# A complete binary tree is whose all levels except the last level are completely filled and all the leaves in the last level are all to the left side.
